# Working with Files

The Sandbox SDK provides methods to manage files in your remote sandbox environment.

## Creating a File

```python
sdk.create_file(
    "hello.py",  # Path in the sandbox
    """
    def greet(name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    print(greet("World"))
    """
)
```

After creating the file, you can run it:

```python
result = sdk.run_command("python3 hello.py")
print(result["stdout"])  # Outputs: Hello, World!
```

## Uploading Files

There are two ways to upload files or directories:

### Upload a Single File

```python
sdk.upload_file(
    "local_script.py",         # Path on your local machine
    "/home/user/uploaded.py"   # Destination path in the sandbox
)
```

### Upload an Entire Directory

```python
sdk.write_to_sandbox(
    content="",                    # Ignored for directory uploads
    local_directory="./my_project",
    sandbox_directory="/home/user/project"
)
```

## Reading Files

```python
# Read text file
content = sdk.read_sandbox_file("/home/user/hello.py")
print(content)

# Read binary data
binary = sdk.read_sandbox_file(
    "/home/user/image.png",
    as_string=False
)
```

## Downloading Files

```python
# Download a file from the sandbox to your local machine
sdk.download_file(
    "/home/user/results.txt",  # Path in sandbox
    "local_results.txt"        # Local destination
)
```
