# Sandbox SDK

The `SandboxSDK` extends cloudcode's AI coding capabilities to an isolated, secure, cloud-based sandbox environment. This allows you to safely:

- Execute code without impacting your local system
- Apply AI-assisted code modifications and view diffs
- Run shell commands and manage dependencies
- Upload, download, and read files in an isolated workspace
- Manage sandbox lifecycle (info, extend, terminate)

Use the Sandbox SDK when you need a safe, reproducible environment for experimentation, testing, or running code that shouldn't affect your local machine.
