## What is cloudcode SDK?

Cloud Code is a progamable AI Coder SDK.

Despite it's name, we offer both local and remote coding enviornments.

You can think of it as being able to code interactions with coding apps such as cursor or claude code.

It was made out of the need to automate coding tasks that are becoming repetitive such as creating documentation for codebases, optimizing prompts, and creating a better AI Coding experience.

## Key Components

The SDK consists of two main components:
