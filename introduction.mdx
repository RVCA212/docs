## What is Cloud Coding?

Cloud Coding is an AI-powered coding assistant that lets you modify your GitHub repositories using plain English. Just point Claude at your repo, tell it what changes you'd like to see, and it handles the rest—no complicated setups or confusing scripts required.

Under the hood, our API safely clones your repository into a virtual environment. From there, Claude explores your code, makes modifications, and pushes the updates back directly to your GitHub repository.

## How It Works

Using Cloud Coding is straightforward:

1. **Send an API request** with your GitHub repo URL and your instructions.
2. **Claude clones and explores** your repository in a secure, isolated VM.
3. **Claude makes the changes** you've described, step-by-step.
4. **The finished code** is pushed back automatically to your GitHub repository.

## Coolest Feature: Templates ✨

With Templates, you can script multiple instructions into a single workflow. Claude follows these instructions sequentially, making it easy to automate tasks like code planning, analysis, refactoring, and even generating documentation.

Think of Templates like reusable coding recipes—you create the steps once, and Claude handles the rest every time.
