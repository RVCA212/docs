## What is Cloud Coding API?

Cloud Coding is a powerful AI coding agent accessible through a simple REST API. Point it at any GitHub repository and let Claude analyze, modify, or interact with your codebase using natural language.

Our API clones your repository into a secure sandbox environment where Claude can explore the codebase, understand its structure, make changes, and push results back to your GitHub repository.

## How It Works

1. **Make an API call** with your repository URL and instructions
2. **Claude analyzes** your codebase in a secure sandbox
3. **AI makes changes** based on your natural language requests
4. **Results are pushed** back to your GitHub repository
