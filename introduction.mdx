## What is Cloud Code SDK?

Cloud Code is a progamable AI Coder SDK.

Despite it's name, we offer both local and remote coding enviornments.

You can think of it as being a way to how coding apps such as cursor or claude code act and are used. Buit instead of these coding apps, have use our own llm that can modify code from natural language.

It was made out of the need to automate coding tasks that are becoming repetitive such as creating documentation for codebases, optimizing prompts, and creating a better AI Coding experience.

I find myself going through the same flow when coding with Cursor and Claude Code, so I'm hoping to replicate my coding process through using this SDK.

## Key Components

The SDK consists of two main components:

  <Card
    title="Local SDK"

    href="/quickstart"
  >
    AI Coding Agent in your local environment with low level access to your file system and tools for managing the file system.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Sandbox SDK"
    icon="shield-halved"
    href="/sandbox-sdk"
  >
    Runs in a remote coding sandbox with the same experience as the local sdk.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
