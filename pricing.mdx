title: Pricing
---

Our pricing model is simple and transparent:

- **You pay for what you use.**
- We charge a **15% upcharge** on your Anthropic API costs.
- **You provide your own Anthropic API key** for direct billing from Anthropic and are charged by cloud coding seperately.

## How It Works

1. **Set your Anthropic API key:** Add it to your dashboard at [cloudcoding.ai/home](https://cloudcoding.ai/home) or pass it directly in API calls
2. **Choose your model:** Use Claude Sonnet (default) or Claude Haiku for faster/cheaper operations
3. **Track your usage:** Monitor token usage and costs in real-time
4. **Pay only our 15% fee:** Anthropic bills you directly for model usage

## Pricing Examples

### Claude Sonnet (Default)
If Claude Sonnet costs $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens:

- **Your cost to Anthropic:** $3 input / $15 output per million tokens
- **Our fee:** 15% of your Anthropic costs
- **Total additional cost:** $0.45 input / $2.25 output per million tokens

### Claude Haiku (Faster/Cheaper)
If Claude Haiku costs $0.25 per million input tokens and $1.25 per million output tokens:

- **Your cost to Anthropic:** $0.25 input / $1.25 output per million tokens
- **Our fee:** 15% of your Anthropic costs
- **Total additional cost:** $0.04 input / $0.19 output per million tokens
