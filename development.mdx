  **Prerequisite**: Ensure you've installed the cloudcode SDK and have configured your API keys as described in the [Quickstart](/quickstart).

## Overview
This guide demonstrates advanced Cloud Code SDK features through real examples from the `cloud-coding/examples` folder. We'll walk through key capabilities: Architect Mode, cost tracking, asynchronous tasks, and sandbox management.

## Architect Mode
Leverage a two-model workflow for cost-efficient, high-quality code changes. See `architect.py`:
```python
from cloudcode import Local
import os

sdk = Local(
    working_dir=os.getcwd(),
    model="o4-mini",           # Planner model
    editor_model="gpt-4.1",    # Editor model for concrete changes
    architect_mode=True,
    api_key=os.getenv("CLOUD_CODE_API_KEY")
)

result = sdk.code(
    prompt="Make example.py full of complex math functions",
    editable_files=["example.py"],
    readonly_files=[]
)
print(result["diff"])
```

## Tracking Costs and Credits
Easily monitor your API usage (excerpt from [Architect Example]()):
```python
cost_history = sdk.get_cost_history()
for entry in cost_history:
    print(f"{entry['timestamp']}: ${entry['cost']['message_cost']:.4f}")

totals = sdk.get_total_cost(include_markup=True)
print(f"Total cost: ${totals['total_cost']:.2f}")
```

## Asynchronous Tasks (Headless)
Run long-running tasks without blocking your application (see [Headless Mode](/local-sdk/headless)):
```python
task = sdk.code_headless(
    prompt="Refactor large codebase to modern patterns",
    editable_files=["src/main.py"],
    readonly_files=["src/config.py"]
)
task_id = task["task_id"]
```

## Sandbox Management
Work on entire projects securely in a sandbox (inspired by `quick-start.py`):
```python
from cloudcode import SandboxSDK
import os

sdk = SandboxSDK(
    model="gpt-4.1",  # Main (planner) model
    editor_model="gpt-4.1-nano",  # Editor model for implementing changes
    architect_mode=True,
    api_key=os.getenv("CLOUD_CODE_API_KEY"),
)

# Get information about the sandbox
sandbox_info = sdk.get_sandbox_info()
print(f"Sandbox created: {sandbox_info['sandbox_id']}")
print(f"Sandbox will expire at: {sandbox_info['end_at']}")


kill_result = sdk.kill_sandbox()
print(f"Sandbox termination: {kill_result['message']}")
print(f"Termination success: {kill_result['success']}")
```
