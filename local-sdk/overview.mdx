# Local SDK

The `Local` class is the primary entry point for using the cloudcode Python SDK in your projects.

This Class is the lowest level sdk you'll need to create an AI Coding agent.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Code Modification**: Transform code with natural language prompts using leading AI models like GPT-4 and Claude
- **File Management**: Create, read, modify, and search files in your local environment
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and manage your API usage with detailed cost reporting
- **Git Integration**: Optional tracking of changes via git for easy review and rollback
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Run long coding tasks in the background with headless mode
- **Architect Mode**: Use a two-model approach for better efficiency and performance

## When to Use Local SDK

The Local SDK is ideal when you want to:

- Integrate AI-assisted coding into your own applications or workflows
- Work with code in your existing local environment
- Maintain control over your files and version control
- Track costs and manage API usage programmatically

## Quick Start Example

Run the real Quick Start script included in the examples:
```bash
python cloud-coding/examples/quick-start.py
```

This script will:
- Create `src/calculator.py`
- Add `multiply` and `divide` functions with zero-division handling
- Print the diff and updated file content

Here's the core snippet from `quick-start.py`:

```python
from cloudcode import Local
import os

sdk = Local(working_dir=os.getcwd(), api_key=os.getenv("CLOUD_CODE_API_KEY"))

result = sdk.code(
    prompt="Add multiply and divide functions to the calculator with zero-division handling.",
    editable_files=["src/calculator.py"]
)

if result["success"]:
    print("Changes:", result["diff"])
    print("Updated content:", sdk.read_file("src/calculator.py"))
```
