# File Management with the Local SDK

The Local SDK provides a set of methods for managing files in your project directory. This guide explains how to use these methods, referencing the actual implementation in our [LangGraph React App](https://github.com/LMSystems-ai/cloud-coding/blob/main/langgraph/src/react.py). At the end, you'll find a unified example script that demonstrates all file operations together.

## Overview of File Tools

The main file management methods are:

- **create_file(file_path, content)**: Create or overwrite a file with the given content.
- **read_file(file_path)**: Read and return the content of a file.
- **search_files(query, file_patterns)**: Search for lines matching a query across files.

All file paths are **relative to your SDK's working directory**. The SDK will automatically create parent directories if they don't exist.

> **Tip:** The SDK is designed for text files. For binary files, use encoding/decoding (see below).

---

## Method Reference

### 1. Creating Files

```python
def create_file(file_path: str, content: str) -> bool
```
- **file_path** (`str`): Path to the file, relative to working_dir
- **content** (`str`): Text content to write
- **Returns** (`bool`): `True` on success, `False` otherwise

### 2. Reading Files

```python
def read_file(file_path: str) -> Optional[str]
```
- **file_path** (`str`): Path to the file, relative to working_dir
- **Returns** (`str` or `None`): File content as string, or `None` if the file does not exist

### 3. Searching Files

```python
def search_files(query: str, file_patterns: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> Dict[str, List[str]]
```
- **query** (`str`): Substring or regex to match
- **file_patterns** (`List[str]`, optional): Glob patterns for files to search (default: `['**/*']`)
- **Returns** (`Dict[str, List[str]]`): Mapping of file paths to lists of matching lines

## Unified Example: All File Operations

Below is a complete script that demonstrates how to use all file management commands together. This example is based on the actual usage in [`react.py`](../../cloud-coding/langgraph/src/react.py):

```python
from cloudcode import Local
import os

# Set your project directory and API key
your_project_dir = "/path/to/your/project"
sdk = Local(
    working_dir=your_project_dir,
    api_key=os.getenv("CLOUD_CODE_API_KEY"),
)

# 1. Create a new file
file_path = "src/example.py"

file_content = """
def hello(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
"""

created = sdk.create_file(file_path, file_content)
if created:
    print(f"Created file: {file_path}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to create file: {file_path}")


# 2. Read the file back
content = sdk.read_file(file_path)
if content is not None:
    print(f"\nRead from {file_path}:\n{content}")
else:
    print(f"File {file_path} does not exist or could not be read.")


# 3. Search for a function definition in all Python files
search_query = "def hello"
search_results = sdk.search_files(
    query=search_query,
    file_patterns=["src/**/*.py"]
)
print(f"\nSearch results for '{search_query}':")
for path, lines in search_results.items():
    print(f"- {path}")
    for line in lines:
        print(f"    {line.strip()}")


# 4. (Optional) Handling binary files
import base64
binary_data = b'\x00\x01\x02\x03'
encoded = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode('utf-8')
sdk.create_file("data/binary.dat", encoded)
read_encoded = sdk.read_file("data/binary.dat")
if read_encoded:
    binary_content = base64.b64decode(read_encoded)
    print(f"\nRead {len(binary_content)} bytes from binary.dat")
```

---

## Best Practices

- **Use relative paths** for portability.
- **Check file existence** before reading or overwriting.
- **Use specific glob patterns** in `search_files` for performance.
- **Process search results programmatically** to identify relevant files.
- **Handle binary files** with encoding/decoding as shown above.

## More Advanced Usage

You can combine file operations with the `code()` and `code_headless()` methods for AI-powered code editing. See the [AI Coding](./ai-coding) page for details.
