The Local SDK can integrate with Git to track changes, generate diffs, and make it easier to review and manage AI-assisted code modifications.

**Most importantly, enabling Git integration gives the AI coding assistant (especially in architect mode) much better context about your entire repository and project.**

When Git is enabled, the assistant can:
- See the full project structure, history, and relationships between files
- Understand which files are tracked, ignored, or recently changed
- Use commit history and diffs to make smarter, safer edits
- Plan and coordinate multi-file changes more reliably in architect mode

## Enabling Git Integration

When initializing the Local SDK, set the `use_git` parameter to `True`:

```python
from cloudcode import Local
import os

sdk = Local(
    working_dir="/path/to/your/git/repo",
    model="gpt-4.1-nano",
    api_key=os.getenv("CLOUDCODE_API_KEY"),
    use_git=True  # Enable Git integration
)
```

When Git integration is enabled:
- Your working directory must be within a Git repository
- Changes made by the AI will be automatically staged but not committed
- The `diff` returned by the `code()` method will contain a Git-formatted diff
- You can easily review, commit, or revert changes using standard Git commands
- **The AI assistant will have a much deeper understanding of your project context, leading to higher quality and safer code changes.**


## Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from cloudcode import Local
import os
import subprocess

sdk = Local(
    working_dir="/path/to/your/git/repo",
    api_key=os.getenv("CLOUDCODE_API_KEY"),
    use_git=True
)

# Modify code with AI
result = sdk.code(
    prompt="Add input validation to the user registration function",
    editable_files=["src/auth.py"]
)

if result["success"]:
    print("Changes made and staged in Git:")
    print(result["diff"])

    # Commit the changes
    commit_message = "Add input validation to user registration"
    subprocess.run(["git", "commit", "-m", commit_message], cwd=sdk.working_dir)
    print(f"Changes committed: {commit_message}")
else:
    print("No significant changes were made.")
```
