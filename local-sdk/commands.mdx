description: 'Execute shell commands in your project or sandbox with the Local SDK'
---

The Local SDK provides methods to execute shell commands in your environment or in a secure sandbox. This is useful for automating tasks, running tests, or interacting with your codebase programmatically.

## When to Use Command Execution

- Automate build, test, or deployment steps as part of your AI workflows
- Run shell commands in a controlled, isolated environment (sandbox)
- Integrate command output into your coding agent's workflow

> **Note:**
> - The `run_command` method is only available on the `SandboxSDK` class, not on the base `Local` class.
> - Use the sandbox for running untrusted or potentially dangerous commands.

## Quick Start Example

First, create a `SandboxSDK` instance:

```python
from cloudcode import SandboxSDK
import os

sdk = SandboxSDK(api_key=os.getenv("CLOUD_CODE_API_KEY"))
```

Now, run a shell command in the sandbox:

```python
result = sdk.run_command("ls -l /home/user")

print("Exit code:", result["exit_code"])
print("STDOUT:\n", result["stdout"])
print("STDERR:\n", result["stderr"])
```

### Example: Run Python Tests in the Sandbox

```python
# Suppose you have uploaded your project files to the sandbox already
result = sdk.run_command("pytest tests/")

if result["exit_code"] == 0:
    print("All tests passed!")
else:
    print("Test failures detected:")
    print(result["stdout"])
```

## Command Execution API

### `run_command(command: str) -> dict`

Runs a shell command in the sandbox and returns a dictionary with:
- `exit_code`: The command's exit code (0 means success)
- `stdout`: The standard output of the command
- `stderr`: The standard error output

#### Example

```python
result = sdk.run_command("echo Hello, world!")
print(result["stdout"])  # Output: Hello, world!
```

## Best Practices

- Use the sandbox for any commands that modify files, install packages, or could affect system state.
- Always check the `exit_code` to determine if the command succeeded.
- For long-running commands, consider using headless mode or background jobs.
- Upload any required files to the sandbox before running commands that depend on them.
