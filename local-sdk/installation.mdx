# Installing the Local SDK

Getting started with the cloudcode SDK is straightforward. Follow these steps to install and set up the SDK in your environment.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pip package manager
- Access to cloudcode API key (or provider API keys)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install via pip

The simplest way to install the cloudcode SDK is via pip:

```bash
pip install cloudcode
```

This will install both the Local SDK and the Sandbox SDK components.

### 2. Verify Installation

You can verify the installation by importing the SDK in a Python script:

```python
from cloudcode import Local

# Check available models
models = Local.list_models()
print(models)  # This should print a list of available AI models
```

## Setting Up API Keys

### Option 1: Using cloudcode API Key (Recommended)

```python
import os
from cloudcode import Local

# Set environment variable (recommended for security)
os.environ["CLOUDCODE_API_KEY"] = "your_cloudcode_api_key"

# Or pass directly to the SDK
sdk = Local(
    working_dir="/path/to/your/project",
    api_key="your_cloudcode_api_key"
)
```

Using the cloudcode API key is recommended as it automatically handles provider keys and enables credit tracking.

### Option 2: Using Provider API Keys Directly

```python
from cloudcode import Local

sdk = Local(
    working_dir="/path/to/your/project",
    api_keys={
        "openai": "your_openai_key",
        "anthropic": "your_anthropic_key"
    }
)
```

Note that this legacy method only supports OpenAI and Anthropic keys.

## Next Steps

Once you've installed the SDK and set up your API keys, you can:

- Learn about [configuration options](/local-sdk/configuration)
- Start [modifying code with AI](/local-sdk/code)
- Explore [file management capabilities](/local-sdk/files)

For more advanced usage, check out the [Advanced Usage](/advanced-usage) guide.

## Quick Start Example

After installing and setting up your API key, try the included Quick Start script:

```bash
python cloud-coding/examples/quick-start.py
```

This script will:
- Create `src/calculator.py`
- Add `multiply` and `divide` functions with zero-division handling
- Print the diff and updated file content
